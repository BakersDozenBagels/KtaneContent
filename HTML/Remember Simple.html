                <h2>On the Subject of Remember Simple</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Do I just keep pressing this button?</p>

                <p>This module has a black background and a blue button.
                   Every time a <a href="../More/Ignore%20Table.html">non-ignored module</a> is solved, this button will have to be pressed.</p>
                <p>If the button is pressed too much, too little, or in a strike loophole (below paragraph), it will strike.
                   If it is pressed consistently and is pressed when the last non-ignored module is solved, it will solve.</p>

                <p>There are loopholes in this module.
                   The first loophole is that if there are an odd amount of modules on the bomb that is greater than 1,
                   all but one unignored modules are solved without pressing the button, and the button is pressed before solving the last unignored module,
                   the module will solve early.
                   A second loophole is that if the button is pressed all the way throughout the bomb except before solving the last non-ignored module,
                   the module will continuously strike, so avoid that!</p>
