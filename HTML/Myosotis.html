                <p>To solve this module, collect enough flowers to reach a non-specific limit. Flowers collected late in
                    a bomb will count for more than flowers collected early.</p>
                <p>Every once in a while, the flower will grow randomly, but only when you haven't been working on it
                    for a while. These wild flowers may be tricky to work with.</p>
                <p>Selecting a branch will prune it from the flower, and zero, one, two, or three more will grow to replace
                    it. These new branches will each split exactly once, resulting in a Y figure.</p>
                <p>Pruning the entire flower (by selecting its base) will add it to your collection. A good flower has
                    the following traits:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It highly resembles a ternary tree, i.e. at each branch it splits into three.</li>
                    <li>Its ends are all about as far away from the base as each other.</li>
                    <li>It is not too small.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Better flowers will count for more than worse ones.</p>
