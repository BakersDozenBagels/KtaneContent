                <h2>On the Subject of The Egg Hunt</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">many egg time :)</p>
                <p>Welcome to this year's annual Egg Festival! Today, you'll be judging the big Egg Hunt! It's an
                    important job, so you'd best take it seriously.</p>
                <p>This year's hunters are Ruby, Vera, Blake, and Jane. They will each start in a different corner of
                    the 3 by 3 play area. Each hunter's basket will be in their starting corner. They each grab an egg
                    at their starting location.</p>
                <p>Each of them must find all of their colored eggs. The hunt is a race, too. The contestants are judged
                    by who can find their eggs first.</p>
                <p>The number of eggs for each hunter to find is equal to the number of non-ignored modules on your
                    bomb, though no fewer than 5. Whenever one of them is solved, you'll get more information on the
                    gathered eggs. You can go back and watch the replays at any time, too.</p>
                <p>Your information comes in maps. The first map will show the location of the first egg each hunter
                    picked up, the second the second, etc. Each egg is colored based on who picked it up, and each
                    hunter's eggs will all point in a specific direction.</p>
                <p>The time it takes a hunter to reach their next egg is equal to the square of the distance they have
                    to move. They're competitive, so they'll never slow down or get distracted.</p>
                <p>Once a hunter reaches their next egg, they'll instantly pick it up and continue on to the next one.
                    Some eggs will have other effects when picked up.</p>
                <p>Once the hunt ends, you'll need to rank the contestants. The fastest time will get a golden egg,
                    second a silver egg, third a bronze egg, and fourth nothing. If there's a tie, all tied hunters get
                    that egg. However, since this event is just for fun, you should upgrade the prizes if one would have
                    been skipped.</p>
                <p>When submitting the results, touching the award will change what you're giving out. Once all four
                    hunters have an award, you will be done. If you're wrong, the answer won't change.</p>
