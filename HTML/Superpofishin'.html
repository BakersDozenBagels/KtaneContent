                <p class="flavour-text">Play some Quantum Go Fish with some tricky fish.</p>
                <p class="appendix-reference">Note: If only one fish appears after pressing Reel, you
                    are looking at the wrong manual!</p>
                <p>To begin, press Reel. Three fish will appear representing one turn in a game of Quantum Go Fish. Use
                    Keep and Throw to navigate between game turns. The rules to Quantum Go Fish can be found on the next
                    page.</p>
                <p>After the last turn, all cards will only have one possibility. Moving past this turn shows twelve
                    fish buttons and an input display. Press Reel here to return to viewing the game turns.</p>
                <p>Input every players' hand to solve the module. The hands can be entered in any order. Input a hand by
                    inputting the player and all of that player's cards. These inputs within a hand can be entered in
                    any order.</p>
                <p>Inputting an invalid will result in a strike. That fish will not be input, but nothing will reset.
                </p>
                <h3>House Rules</h3>
                <p>The fish are tricky, and have decided on some house rules before the game started, but aren't telling
                    them to you. They have chosen which cards to use, and which fish represent yes and no. They have
                    also chosen some order to show you the asked player, the asked card, and the aforementioned
                    yes-no response.</p>
                <p>Importantly, the players are fish, but so is all of the other information.</p>
                <p>The fish don't like to leave someone with no cards, so they will never do that.</p>

                <h3>Quantum Go Fish</h3>
                <p>Each player starts with four indeterminate cards. There are four cards of each suit, and exactly as
                    many suits as there are players in the game.</p>
                <p>Each player takes a turn in order, unless that player has no cards, in which case they are skipped.
                </p>
                <p>On a player's turn, they ask another player "[Player], do you have a [suit] card?", where the asking
                    player already have a card of that suit. The asked player must truthfully respond with "Yes" or
                    "No". If they say "Yes", they give one card of that suit to the player whose turn it is.</p>
                <p>A question or response is only valid if the cards <em>could have always been</em> in some arrangement
                    that makes it valid.</p>
                <p>Another way to think about this is that every card starts in a superposition of every possibility.
                    Every turn partially collapses this superposition, leaving only some possibilities valid.</p>
                <h3>Example Game</h3>
                <p>This example uses players 1, 2, and 3, and card suits A, B, and C.</p>
