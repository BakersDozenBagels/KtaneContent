                <p>On the module, there will be two pressable parallelogram-shaped displays, three triangular buttons arranged in a triforce formation, and another triangular button to the right of them.</p>
                <p>To defuse this module, perform the following steps to obtain a triangular key grid, then use it to obtain your decrypted word to submit into the module using the buttons in arranged in a triforce formation.</p>
                <h3>Step 0: Making the key triangle</h3>
                <p>Create a 7×7 equilateral triangle, with one of its vertices facing South. Place the first letter of the keyword in the first cell in reading order of this triangle. Then, for each subsequent letter in the keyword, if it has been used, find the closest unused letter (with wraparound, so the distance between the letters A and Z is the same as A and B, that being 1), and place it in the next unfilled cell of the triangle. Repeat this until all letters of the keyword have been used, and the top-most row of the triangle has been filled.</p>
                <p>Then, for each subsequent cell, consider the absolute difference between the two alphabetical positions of the two cells immediately above. If the corresponding letter has not been used, place it in the next unfilled cell. Otherwise, follow the same procedure for when a used letter is encountered. Then, place the unused letter in the next unfilled cell. Repeat this until 25 out of the 26 letters in the English alphabet have been used. The remaining letter will be referred to as the “unused letter”. Place #'s in the cells in the second to last row, then the unused letter at the bottom.</p>
                <p><strong>If a previously used letter is encountered and the two nearest unused letters have the same distance to the used letter, take the unused letter that would be reached by going backwards in the alphabet, wrapping from Z to A.</strong></p>

                <h3>Step 1: Caesarean Role-Switching Cipher</h3>
                <p>To decrypt, consider the number of steps forward in the alphabet to get from the first letter to the key letter. Apply this shift to the key letter, and the obtained letter will be the first decrypted letter. Then, apply the same process with the next encrypted letter, and the latest decrypted letter, as the “first letter” and “key letter” respectively, until all encrypted letters have been exhausted.</p>
                <h3>Step 2: Rotational Monoalphabetic Substitution Cipher</h3>
                <p>For this step, the key will be the alphabetic position of the key letter, <a href="./Modulo.html">modulo</a> 2.</p>
                <p>For each letter, find it in the key triangle, rotate your position 120° in the direction found below</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If the digit on the submit button and the key share <a href="./Parity.html">parity</a>, rotate your position clockwise</li>
                    <li>If the digit on the submit button and the key does not share <a href="./Parity.html">parity</a>, rotate your position counter-clockwise</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If a # is landed on, rotate your position 120° again, in the same direction.</p>
                <p>The resulting position will be your decrypted letter.</p>
