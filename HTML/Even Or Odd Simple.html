                <p>The module consists of a timer, a display, and two buttons beside the display.</p>
                <p>To initiate the module, press the display. The timer will begin counting up and the display will show a random number from 0–9. The number that appears will be colored green. Press the button beside the screen which corresponds to the even/odd status of that number.</p>
                <p>Pressing the incorrect button will cause the module to give a strike and the module to reset.</p>
                  <p>A number is considered even if it is an integer which is divisible by two. An integer is a number which does not contain a decimal portion and thus represents a whole number of something. If that number can be divided into two equal parts that are also whole numbers, it is divisible by two. For example, let’s say you have eight apples, and you would like to divide them among two friends so that each person gets an equal number of apples. You can do this by giving four apples to each person, and there won’t be any apples left over. However, if you have nine apples, you can’t do this because you’ll have to cut one of the apples in half. Either that, or somebody will have to get five apples while the other person only gets four. Therefore, eight is divisible by two, while nine is not. If you have a number of apples equal to the number on the display, and you can split those apples equally among two friends without cutting an apple in half, you should press the “even” button. Otherwise, you should press the other button.
