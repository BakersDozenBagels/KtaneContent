<li>Observe the time it takes the six LEDs to rotate one notch, and divide it by the time between cycles of the LED colors.</li>
<li>This ratio is always a fraction whose numerator and denominator, when expressed in lowest terms, are between 1 and 9.</li>
<li>If the LEDs are moving clockwise, hold the button when the last digit of the bombâ€™s countdown timer is equal to the numerator, and release it when the last digit is equal to the denominator.</li>
<li>If the LEDs are moving counter-clockwise, do the same but with the numerator and denominator swapped.</li>
