            <h1>A Way With Words</h1>
			<p><font size="2pt">The following excerpt is not a puzzle:</font><br><font size="3pt">Six experts finally find the time to get together and catch up, but one is running late. They are all eager to play their favorite game. The game starts with everyone receiving a 5 letter word card. Each turn, players create a rule to "assist" them in getting points throughout the game. The rule is publicly stated at the start of the round. The colors/fonts are used to discern voices but are not used to solve the puzzle.</font></p>

			<p class="Headers">Round 1: Vincent's Turn</p>
			
            <p>
			<span class="Person1">Ugh, only one point this turn... the ABOUT card really is bad luck.</span>
			<br>
			<span class="Person2">Cheer up Bob, it's only the first round.</span>
			<br>
			<span class="Person3">Says the one that just got 29 points from that rule with a THREE card…</span>
			</p>
			
			<p class="Headers">Round 2: Emmanuel's Turn</p>
			
			<p>
			<span class="Person2">Uhh... What position is V again?</span>
			<br>
			<span class="Person4">Twenty-two, how do you keep forgetting?</span>
			<br>
			<span class="Person5">Great idea linking Vincent’s indexing here, but I only got fifty-four points.</span>
			<br>
			<span class="Person4">Yeah, I think I’m second lowest with seventy-one points.</span>
			</p>
			
			<p class="Headers">Round 3: Bob's Turn</p>
			
			<p>
			<span class="Person4">Well looks like Bob gave the win to Vincent, enjoy that Orange 9x multiplier.</span>
			<br>
			<span class="Person2">No no, Ned is still in the running with Cyan.</span>
			<br>
			<span class="Person1">I have a Black card and Emmanuel has a Gray card.</span>
			</p>
			
			<p class="Headers">Round 4: Samantha's Turn</p>
			
			<p>
			<span class="Person2">Hey Emmanuel! One of our shuffles leads to each other! That has to be bonus points right?</span>
			<br>
			<span class="Person4">Sorry, you are already leagues ahead of us. Enjoy your +2 points while I get my +3.</span>
			<br>
			<span class="Person5">If only my K was a G. No points for me this round.</span>
			</p>
			
			<p class="Headers">Round 5: Ned's(?) Turn</p>
			
			<p>
			<span> Before Ned finalizes his rule, the last expert finally arrives.</span>
			<br>
			<span class="Person4">Hey Penelope, we're almost done with this game. Just need a few more points to win!</span>
			<br>
			<span class="Person6">With that blue card you have I sincerely doubt that.</span>
			</p>
			
			<p>
			<span>Laughter fills the room as Penelope walks around to view everyone's cards.</span>
			<br>
			<span class="Person4">Why don't you make your own turn for us? Ned's rule wasn’t going to give anyone points.</span>
			<br>
			<span class="Person5">I said I was sorry!</span>
			<br>
			<span class="Person6">I don't see why not, hmm…</span>
			</p>
			
			<p>
			<span class="Person6"><u>Drop every occurrence of a "single letter" type. So just from the look of it you shouldn't drop anything.</u></span>
			<br>
			<span class="Person4">So we multiply by remaining letters so I could win right?</span>
			<br>
			<span class="Person6">Funnily enough, forgetting about the points for a second.</span>
			<br>
			<span class="Person6">The last and first place cards remind me of berries as well (5).</span>
			</p>
			
			<p>
			<span>Everyone else looks at each other confused.</span>
			<br>
			<span class="Person1">W</span><span class="Person2">h</span><span class="Person3">a</span><span class="Person4">t</span><span class="Person5">?</span>
